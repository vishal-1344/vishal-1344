I study intelligence as a dynamical interactive process. My research focuses on adaptive inference, stability-aware
reasoning, and latent geometric structure in learned systems. I investigate how models regulate their
own computation, detect instability, and adapt internal representations over time—drawing on ideas
from control theory, nonlinear dynamics, signal processing, and structured multi-agent coordination.

## Research Themes

**Adaptive inference & closed-loop reasoning**  
Viewing inference as a trajectory that can be monitored, regulated, and adjusted using discrepancy
signals and stability measures.

**Stability, safety & interpretability**  
Using Lyapunov-style energy functions, early-warning diagnostics, and off-manifold detection to
anticipate failure and support reliable decision-making.

**Latent structure & slow-timescale adaptation**  
Studying how internal geometry evolves over time under novelty and prediction error, shaping robust
behavior in changing environments.

**Geometric & multi-process reasoning**  
Modeling cognition as interconnected reasoning processes coupled through shared geometric fields and
interaction dynamics.

## What I Aim to Build

My long-term research direction is to help develop intelligent systems whose reasoning is not merely
feed-forward, but dynamically regulated, structurally adaptive, and grounded in principles from
dynamical systems and control. These systems should know when to think deeper, when to stop, when
to adapt structure, and how to maintain coherent internal organization over long horizons.
