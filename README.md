# Vishal Joshua Meesala

I study intelligence as a dynamical, interactive process. My research focuses on adaptive inference, stability-aware reasoning, and latent geometric structure in learned systems. I investigate how models regulate their own computation, detect instability, and adapt internal representations over time, drawing on ideas from control theory, nonlinear dynamics, signal processing, structured multi-agent coordination, and systems neuroscience.

## Research Themes

**Adaptive inference & closed-loop reasoning**  
Viewing inference as a trajectory that can be monitored, regulated, and adjusted using discrepancy
signals and stability measures.

**Stability, safety & interpretability**  
Using Lyapunov-style energy functions, early-warning diagnostics, and off-manifold detection to
anticipate failure and support reliable decision-making.

**Latent structure & slow-timescale adaptation**  
Studying how internal geometry evolves over time under novelty and prediction error, shaping robust
behavior in changing environments.

**Geometric & multi-process reasoning**  
Modeling cognition as interconnected reasoning processes coupled through shared geometric fields and interaction dynamics, with inspiration from recurrent cortical circuits and multi-timescale plasticity.

## What I Aim to Build

My long-term research direction is to help develop intelligent systems that complement standard feed-forward pipelines with dynamically regulated and structurally adaptive reasoning, informed by principles from dynamical systems, control, and systems neuroscience. I take inspiration from recurrent cortical circuits, multi-timescale plasticity, and neuromodulatory feedback in designing models that can allocate more computation when needed, know when to stop, adapt their internal structure, and maintain coherent organization over long horizons.
